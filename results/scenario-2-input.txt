Hi Jane, Mike,

Thank you both – that’s very generous and reasonable. I’m comfortable covering the additional €2,000 from savings and happy we found a middle ground.
Mike – please move forward with the updated paperwork for €153,000 and send over the revised credit agreement when ready.
Jane – I’ll ask my notary to propose a few slots between 6–9 August.
Excited to get this done!

Cheers,

Hi Mike, Alin,

Thanks for the transparency.
Alin – I understand this has been a process for you, and I don’t want to block your efforts. I’m willing to accept €153,000 and move forward, if we can schedule the notary before August 10th. That way I can align with my own moving timeline.
Let’s finalize this – I’d be happy to sell to you.

Best,

Hi Alin, Jane,

Alin – after a quick internal review, we can approve an additional €5,000, bringing your credit ceiling to €153,000, under the same conditions (interest rate and term). However, you would need to cover the remaining €2,000 difference through your own contribution.

Jane – would you consider splitting the difference with Alin to help close the sale? Perhaps meeting in the middle could make this work for both sides.

Let me know your thoughts so we can move quickly.

Hi Jane, Mike,

Jane – I respect your position, but this comes as a surprise. We agreed on €148,000 and I’ve already paid for valuation, legal checks, and initiated paperwork with the bank based on that amount.

Mike – Is there any way the bank can increase the approved amount to match the new price? Otherwise, I’d be forced to withdraw.

I still really want the house, but I’m already stretched with my budget.

Thanks,

Dear Jane, Alin,

I’m pleased to inform you that the credit application for Mr. Alin Pisica has been officially approved. The credit covers the initially agreed price of €148,000 for the property located at 24 Linden Street.

Next steps:

We can begin preparing the pre-contract.
The notary appointment can be set once Jane confirms availability.
Please confirm if there are any last-minute changes to the agreed terms.

Looking forward to your confirmation to proceed.

Kind regards,
