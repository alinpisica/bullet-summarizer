Subject: Re: Urgent: FitFit Launch Status – Bugs Still in QA?
============ Forwarded message ============


Will do, Jane.
I’ll prepare a fallback launch plan (Aug 21) with revised Marketing and QA checkpoints just in case. Will share with you tomorrow morning.
Also, I suggest we lock down any non-critical merges starting Monday. Alin, let’s finalize that cutoff list on our 10AM sync tomorrow.
We’ll make this launch happen 💪

Thanks both, this gives me more confidence.
Mike – let’s get a contingency plan in place anyway. Can you prep a quick internal doc outlining what the “Plan B” would look like if we needed to delay by 5 days?
Alin – great work jumping on these issues. Please send me a short daily update until the weekend. Doesn’t need to be long – just a few bullet points so I can keep stakeholders in the loop.

Thanks,

Hi Mike, Jane,
Quick update on my side:
✅ iOS crash: root cause found (Bluetooth permission regression in the new onboarding flow). Fix is in progress, should be in QA before lunch.
🔄 Sync issue: looks like the wearable module sends a malformed timestamp when the phone app is in background mode. I'm working on a patch that auto-corrects it on the mobile side. ETA: end of day.
If we don’t find anything new, both of these will be resolved this week.
Let me know if anything else pops up.

Best,

Hi Jane,

I understand the concern. I’ve already gone through the high-priority issues. Out of the 7:

3 are already in review, fix is done.
2 are visual bugs on smaller Android screens – not launch blockers in my opinion.
1 involves syncing between wearable and mobile – that one needs deeper investigation.
1 crash reported on some iOS builds – flagged by QA yesterday.

Alin is working on the iOS crash right now. I’ll let him chime in on the sync issue.
We should be fine for 16th if we stay focused. I don’t recommend postponing yet.

Cheers,

Hi Mike, Alin,

I’ve just reviewed the QA dashboard this morning and noticed that we still have 7 open bugs marked as “high priority”. With only 15 days until launch, I’m getting worried.

Can we please regroup and assess:

- Which of these are actual blockers?
- What’s realistically going to be fixed before the 16th?
- Do we need to consider pushing back the launch?

Let’s sync before EOD. I’d appreciate a written update before 2PM so I can align with Marketing.

Thanks,
